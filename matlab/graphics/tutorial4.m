% TUTORIAL 4                                 By Deniz Savas, February 2016
%      Creating and modifying graphs interactively.
% The previous tutorial has been on graphics creation by using the command
% line. The same effects can be achieved, by simply editing graphs
% interactively. 
% TASK 1: Load the data presented in field.dat by using the load command.
%         Copy each of the three columns into  three arrays under different
%         names.  For example,   speed, revs, accel .
% TASK 2: Inserting, LEGENS, TITLES, ANNOTATIONS, LABELS etc...
%          Plot all three variables under one graph. 
%          Create a legend by Clicking on Insert Legend Icon 
%         A legend can be also created by selecting the 
%         Figure > Insert command
%         Try inserting other objects into the graph via Figure>Insert
%
%
% TASK 3: Clear the graph using CLF and draw just one of the columns of
%         data. Click on TOOLS>BAsic Fitting. In the panel that opens
%         Select the degrees of polynomial to fit. Also Show the equation. 
%         Select "Plot Residuals" as a "scatter plot". 
% TASK 4: Select Tools > Data Statistics. 
%         Save the Y data statistics as a structure into the workspace and
%         try to access for example the standard deviation from within the
%         workspace or the command line.
