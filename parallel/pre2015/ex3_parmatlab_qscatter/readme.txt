Illustration of distributing a problem using parallel matlab two examples
are provided of distributing results across the processors and gathering the final result
on to a single processor.

Solution of Schrodinger equation using 
(Rayleigh scattering problem for a spherically symmetric potential
uses Numerov solver to solve the radial equation)

The Problem is evaluated for a range of energies a different range 
is evaluated on different processors
