function Y = myfourier( x , L , Fs , NFFT )
% Returns the fast fourier transforms of time-domain signal x for NFFT  
% terms ( frequencies ) . Note NFFT must always be  a power of 2. 
%  x =  the original signal ( time domain )
%  L = length of signal
%  Fs = sampling frequency
%  NFFT = Number of terms in the fourier series

Y = fft(x,NFFT)/L;
